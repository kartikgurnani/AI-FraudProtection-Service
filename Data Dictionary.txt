- **Purpose**: To monitor account activity and verify consistency.

**nameDest**  
- Identifier of the transaction recipient.  
- **Format**: String, e.g., "C1666544295".  
- **Note**: Customers with 'M' prefix are merchants and do not have associated balances.

**oldbalanceDest**  
- Recipient's account balance before the transaction.
